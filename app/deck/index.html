### What?
]
.right-column[
Gearly is an online marketplace and rental service, enabling people to list or rent gear including guitars, amplifiers, keyboards, microphones, drums, cameras, camera lenses, tripods, lighting rigs, video cameras, and more. Gearly does not own any gear; Gearly is only a broker which receives percentage based service fees from each successfully completed transaction on the platform.

### Why?
]
.right-column[
When I set out to create a platform for musicians to rent and list their music gear, I always reminded myself of who the customer was... Me. I created Gearly so that I could borrow gear from my neighbors in Brooklyn. I started by listing my own gear on the platform. Then soon, other people started listing, then I rented it and formed a great relationship and conversation around their gear.
