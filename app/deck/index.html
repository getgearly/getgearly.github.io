### Why?
]
.right-column[
When I set out to create a platform for musicians to rent and list their music gear, I always reminded myself of who the customer was... Me. I created Gearly so that I could borrow gear from my neighbors in Brooklyn. I started by listing my own gear on the platform. Then soon, other people started listing, then I rented it and formed a great relationship and conversation around their gear.
